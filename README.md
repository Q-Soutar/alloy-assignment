Alloy technical assessment for Quinn Soutar
App Dtails:
- Express.js Node backend
- React frontend
- Material UI for components
- A few additional packages to faciliate certain functionalities (node-fetch, dayjs, etc.)
- Front end consists of a form with required fields
- Submission sends an HTTP request to backend
- Backend hits the Alloy API with the evaluation request
- Request is processed, and appropriate result message is displayed to the user in the React client

Instructions:
- You will need to set up a .env file with proper token and secret for the workflow
- Triple check proxy is set up in the Client, to prevent CORS headaches
- Use NPM to spin up the client and server (app.js in each)
- Proceed with testing by filling out the form
- Specific notes on the app are inline with comments, but I am happy to discuss any details of the demo app!
